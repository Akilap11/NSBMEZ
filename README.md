## Description

NSBMEZ is a mobile application developed for NSBM Green University with the aim of enhancing the overall experience for students, lecturers, and faculty members. This project focuses on providing various functionalities to streamline daily activities within the university. The key features of the application include:

- **Transport Service Timetable and Bus Availability:** This feature allows users to access the timetable for the university's transport services and check bus availability in real-time.

- **Lecture Timetable and Notification System:** The application provides an organized lecture timetable and a notification system to keep users updated about their class schedules and any changes or announcements.

- **Online Payment Method:** NSBMEZ offers a convenient online payment method, allowing users to make secure payments for various services and facilities provided by the university.

- **Result View and GPA Calculation:** Students can view their academic results within the application and calculate their GPA (Grade Point Average) based on the grades obtained.

- **Event Allocation Time Table:** The application also includes an event allocation time table, which helps users stay informed about upcoming university events and their allocated schedules.

The front-end design of NSBMEZ is developed using Flutter, a popular framework for building cross-platform applications. The use of Flutter ensures a visually appealing and responsive user interface across both Android and iOS platforms.

For the back-end, the application utilizes Firebase, a powerful and scalable cloud-based platform provided by Google. Firebase offers seamless data storage, real-time database synchronization, and user authentication, making it an ideal choice for managing the application's back-end functionalities.

To enhance the user experience, NSBMEZ integrates APIs for tracking maps and live location services. This feature enables users to track their routes, find locations within the university, and access real-time information about their current position.
